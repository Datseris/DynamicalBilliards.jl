`DynamicalBilliards` is an easy-to-use, modular and extendable Julia package for
dynamical billiards in two dimensions.

!!! warn "Version 2.0 incoming!"
    We are currently finishing the development of v2.0 of `DynamicalBilliards` which will bring massive performance increase, a lot of new features and unfortunately some breaking changes! You can view the [changelog](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalBilliards.jl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to prepare for up coming changes.

    Consider doing `Pkg.checkout("DynamicalBilliards")` to get huge performance
    benefits and a big amount of new features!


!!! tip "Julia Billiard animation"
    Check out the example in the [tutorials](tutorials/examples/#julia-logo-billiard) page to see the code that created and animated the "Julia Billiard"!

## About Billiards

A dynamical billiard is a system where a particle is propagating as a straight line from obstacle to obstacle, performing specular reflection at the boundary of the obstacles. Billiard systems have been used extensively in mathematics, nonlinear dynamics and chaos and played an important role in the development of nonlinear science.

The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards) has many examples of different types of billiards. Also, the [scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamical_billiards) entry is a good read on the subject.

## Features

* Modular creation of a [billiard](basic/high_level/#billiard) from well defined obstacles. **Arbitrary** billiard shapes can be made and no shape is "hard coded".
* Full support for both *straight*  and *magnetic* propagation of a particle in a billiard table. During magnetic propagation the particle orbit is a circle instead of a line! All features exist for both types of propagation!
* Support for creating [random initial conditions](basic/high_level/#random-initial-conditions) in an arbitrary
  billiard.
* [Ray-splitting implementation](ray-splitting): a particle may propagate
  through an obstacle given arbitrary transmission and refraction
  laws. This is also known as a "semiclassical billiard".
* [PoincarÃ© surfaces of section](high_level/#poincare-sections) (intersections with arbitrary plane).
* [Boundary maps](basic/high_level/#boundary-maps).
* [Escape times](basic/high_level/#escape-times) & [mean collision times](basic/high_level/#mean-collision-times).
* [Lyapunov exponents](lyapunovs).
* Easy to use low-level interface.
* Specialized tools for [mushroom billiards](mushroomtools).
* Full support for visualizing and animating billiards and motion in billiards.
* Brutal tests that confirm the package works and overcomes numerical precision issues.

This package does not support finite-sized particles and, as a result, there is
also no support for collision between particles.

## Usage
It is highly suggested to first read the [High Level API](/basic/high_level).

See the [Visualizing](visualizing) page for plotting, animating, etc.

For more advanced usage see the [Low Level API](/basic/low_level) and all other
sections of this documentation.

The discussion about [numerical precision](/physics/#numerical-precision) is done in the [Physics](/physics) page.

The [Lyapunov Exponents](/lyapunovs) page has info on how to compute the Lyapunov
spectrum of a billiard.

## Installation

This package is registered, simply use `Pkg.add("DynamicalBilliards")` to install it.
The [stable documentation](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalBilliards.jl/stable/) accompanies the version installed with `Pkg.add()`.

Plotting is done through the `PyPlot` module. All plotting functions are brought
into scope when `using PyPlot` is done.
