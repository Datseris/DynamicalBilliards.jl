            "text": "High Level API\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards\n was created with easy-of-use as its main cornerstone. With 3 simple steps, the user can get the output of the propagation of a particle in a billiard.\n\n\nIn general, the workflow of \nDynamicalBilliards\n follows these simple steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a billiard.\n\n\nCreate a particle inside that billiard.\n\n\nGet the output you want by using one of the high level functions.\n\n\n\n\nAdding more complexity in your billiard does not add complexity in your code. For example, to implement a ray-splitting billiard you only need to define one additional variable, a dictionary \nDict{Int, Vector{Function}}\n.\n\n\nAfter reading through this basic usage page, you will be able to use all aspects of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations\n\n\nVisualizing the billiards, particles and their motion is one of the most important parts of the \nDynamicalBilliards\n. It is not discussed in this page however, but rather in the \nVisualizing\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard\n\n\nA \nBilliard\n is simply a collection of \nObstacle\n subtypes. Particles are propagating inside a \nBilliard\n, bouncing from obstacle to obstacle while having constant velocity in-between.\n\n\nThere is a \ntutorial\n on how to create your own billiard. In addition, there are many pre-defined billiards that can be found in the \nStandard Billiards Library\n section. That is why knowing how to construct a \nBilliard\n is not important at this point.\n\n\nIn this page we will be using the Bunimovich billiard as an example:\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nbilliard_bunimovich\n()\n \n# using default arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard{Float64} with 4 obstacles:\n  Bottom wall\n  Right semicircle\n  Top wall\n  Left semicircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles\n\n\nA \"particle\" is that thingy that moves around in the billiard. It always moves with velocity measure 1, by convention.\n\n\nCurrently there are two types of particles:\n\n\n\n\nParticle\n, which propagates as a straight line.\n\n\nMagneticParticle\n, which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:\n\n\nx0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n \ny0\n \n=\n \nrand\n();\n\n\n\u03c60\n \n=\n \n2\n\u03c0\n*\nrand\n()\n \n# an angle is enough\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.324647, 0.142048]\nvelocity: [0.573107, 0.81948]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a \nMagneticParticle\n simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:\n\n\n\u03c9\n \n=\n \n0.5\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nMagneticParticle\n(\nx0\n,\n \ny0\n,\n \n\u03c60\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.324647, 0.142048]\nvelocity: [0.573107, 0.81948]\nang. velocity: 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the \n{Float64}\n ?\n\n\nWhen creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with \n{Float64}\n at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for \nall\n numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the \nnumerical precision page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles must be inside the Billiard!\n\n\nKeep in mind that the particle must be initialized \ninside a billiard\n for any functionality to work properly and make sense. If you are not sure what we mean by that, then you should check out the \nlow-level API page\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom initial conditions\n\n\nIf you have a \nBilliard\n which is not a rectangle, creating many random initial conditions inside it can be a pain. Fortunately, the second way to create a particle is to use the following function:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.randominside\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nrandominside(bt::Billiard [, \u03c9])\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a particle with random allowed initial conditions inside the given billiard. If supplied with a second argument the type of the returned particle is \nMagneticParticle\n, with angular velocity \n\u03c9\n.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.274096, 0.612643]\nvelocity: [-0.178995, 0.98385]\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\nmp\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.267054, 0.631786]\nvelocity: [-0.500439, -0.865772]\nang. velocity: 0.5\n\n\n\n\n\nrandominside\n always creates particles with same number type as the billiard.\n\n\n\n\nevolve\n \n \nconstruct\n\n\nNow that we have created a billiard and a particle inside, we want to evolve it! There is a simple function for that, called \nevolve!\n (or \nevolve\n if you don't want to mutate the particle):\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.evolve!\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\nevolve!(p::AbstractParticle, bt::Billiard, t)\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolve the given particle \np\n inside the billiard \nbt\n. If \nt\n is of type \nAbstractFloat\n, evolve for as much time as \nt\n. If however \nt\n is of type \nInt\n, evolve for as many collisions as \nt\n. Return the states of the particle between collisions.\n\n\nThe evolution takes into account the particle's Type. E.g. if \ntypeof(p) \n: MagneticParticle\n then magnetic evolution will take place.\n\n\nThis function mutates the particle, use \nevolve\n otherwise.\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\nct::Vector{T}\n : Collision times.\n\n\nposs::Vector{SVector{2,T}}\n : Positions at the collisions.\n\n\nvels::Vector{SVector{2,T}})\n : Velocities exactly after the collisions.\n\n\n\u03c9\n, either \nT\n or \nVector{T}\n : Angular velocity/ies (returned only for magnetic particles).\n\n\n\n\nUse the function \nconstruct\n to create timeseries of positions and velocities out of these outputs.\n\n\nThe time \nct[i+1]\n is the time necessary to reach state \nposs[i+1], vels[i+1]\n starting from the state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n. That is why \nct[1]\n is always 0 since \nposs[1], vels[1]\n are the initial conditions. The angular velocity \n\u03c9[i]\n is the one the particle has while propagating from state \nposs[i], vels[i]\n to \ni+1\n.\n\n\nNotice that at any point, the velocity vector \nvels[i]\n is the one obtained \nafter\n the specular reflection of the \ni-1\nth collision. The function \nconstruct\n takes that into account.\n\n\nRay-splitting billiards\n\n\nevolve!(p, bt, t, raysplitters)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo implement ray-splitting, the \nevolve!\n function is supplemented with a fourth argument, \nraysplitters\n which is a tuple of \nRaySplitter\n instances. For more information and instructions on using ray-splitting please visit the official documentation.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nForget the ray-splitting part for now (see \nRay-Splitting\n).\n\n\nLet's see an example:\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n \n=\n \nevolve\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100\n)\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\n5\n\n  \nprintln\n(\nround\n(\nct\n[\ni\n],\n \n3\n),\n \n  \n,\n \nposs\n[\ni\n],\n \n  \n,\n \nvels\n[\ni\n])\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0    [0.274096, 0.612643]  [-0.178995, 0.98385]\n0.394  [0.203623, 1.0]  [-0.178995, -0.98385]\n1.016  [0.0216906, 0.0]  [-0.178995, 0.98385]\n0.991  [-0.155718, 0.975134]  [0.438064, -0.898944]\n1.085  [0.319474, 0.0]  [0.438064, 0.898944]\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, for magnetic propagation\n\n\nct\n,\n \nposs\n,\n \nvels\n,\n \n\u03c9\n \n=\n \nevolve\n(\nmp\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100\n)\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \n1\n:\n10\n\n  \nprintln\n(\nround\n(\nct\n[\ni\n],\n \n3\n),\n \n  \n,\n \nposs\n[\ni\n],\n \n  \n,\n \nvels\n[\ni\n])\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0    [0.267054, 0.631786]  [-0.500439, -0.865772]\n0.677  [0.0329496, 2.94431e-13]  [-0.184546, 0.982824]\n0.947  [-0.351508, 0.855587]  [0.783478, -0.621419]\n1.959  [1.4997, 0.517318]  [-0.971386, 0.237507]\n1.905  [-0.283005, 0.0878011]  [0.338364, 0.941015]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above return types are helpful in some applications.

Currently there are two types of particles:   Particle , which propagates as a straight line.  MagneticParticle , which propagates as a circle instead of a line (similar to electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field).   There are two ways to create a particle. The first one is to provide the constructor with some initial conditions:  x0   =   rand ();   y0   =   rand ();  \u03c60   =   2 \u03c0 * rand ()   # an angle is enough  p   =   Particle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 )   Particle{Float64}\nposition: [0.324647, 0.142048]\nvelocity: [0.573107, 0.81948]  To create a  MagneticParticle  simply provide the constructor with one more number, the angular velocity:  \u03c9   =   0.5  mp   =   MagneticParticle ( x0 ,   y0 ,   \u03c60 ,   \u03c9 )   MagneticParticle{Float64}\nposition: [0.324647, 0.142048]\nvelocity: [0.573107, 0.81948]\nang. velocity: 0.5   Why the  {Float64}  ?  When creating a billiard or a particle, the object is printed with  {Float64}  at the end. This shows what type of numbers are used for  all  numerical operations. If you are curious you can learn more about it in the  numerical precision page .    Particles must be inside the Billiard!  Keep in mind that the particle must be initialized  inside a billiard  for any functionality to work properly and make sense.

            "text": "Now that we have created a billiard and a particle inside, we want to evolve it! There is a simple function for that, called  evolve!  (or  evolve  if you don't want to mutate the particle):  #  DynamicalBilliards.evolve!     Function .  evolve!(p::AbstractParticle, bt::Billiard, t)  Evolve the given particle  p  inside the billiard  bt . If  t  is of type  AbstractFloat , evolve for as much time as  t . If however  t  is of type  Int , evolve for as many collisions as  t . Return the states of the particle between collisions.  The evolution takes into account the particle's Type. E.g. if  typeof(p)  : MagneticParticle  then magnetic evolution will take place.  This function mutates the particle, use  evolve  otherwise.  Returns   ct::Vector{T}  : Collision times.  poss::Vector{SVector{2,T}}  : Positions at the collisions.  vels::Vector{SVector{2,T}})  : Velocities exactly after the collisions.  \u03c9 , either  T  or  Vector{T}  : Angular velocity/ies (returned only for magnetic particles).   Use the function  construct  to create timeseries of positions and velocities out of these outputs.  The time  ct[i+1]  is the time necessary to reach state  poss[i+1], vels[i+1]  starting from the state  poss[i], vels[i] . That is why  ct[1]  is always 0 since  poss[1], vels[1]  are the initial conditions. The angular velocity  \u03c9[i]  is the one the particle has while propagating from state  poss[i], vels[i]  to  i+1 .  Notice that at any point, the velocity vector  vels[i]  is the one obtained  after  the specular reflection of the  i-1 th collision. The function  construct  takes that into account.

            "text": "This page briefly discusses physical aspects of billiard systems.\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Precision\n\n\nAll core types of \nDynamicalBilliards.jl\n are parametrically constructed, with parameter \nT\n:AbstractFloat\n. This means that the fields of all particles and obstacles contain numbers strictly of type \nT\n. You will understand why this choice happened as you continue reading this paragraph.\n\n\nThe main concerns during evolution in a billiard table are:\n\n\n\n\nThe particle must never leak out of the billiard table. This is simply translated to the \ndistance()\n function being \nalways\n positive \nafter\n any collision.\n\n\nThe collision time is never infinite, besides the cases of \npinned particles\n in a magnetic billiard.\n\n\nThe \nrelocate!()\n process is always finite (and very swift!).\n\n\n\n\nThese are solved with the following approach: after the minimum collision time has been calculated, a \"test propagation\" is done on the position of the particle. If the \ndistance(p, obst)\n with the colliding obstacle is found to be \"wrong\", the collision time is reduced by the \nDynamicalBilliards.timeprec(T)\n function, with \nT\n being the parametric type of both the particle and the obstacle. This reduction happens geometrically, i.e. the time adjusting increment is self-multiplied by 10 at each recursive relocating step.\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic propagation and straight propagation both use \ntimeprec(T)\n. For both cases the maximum number of geometric iterations is 1 (for the default value of \ntimeprec(T)\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis \ntimeprec\n cannot be used with \nPeriodicWall\n and RaySplitting obstacles with \nMagneticParticle\ns because when relocating forward in time you get progressively shallower and shallower angles. This means that you need huge changes in time for even tiny changes in \ndistance\n.\n\n\n\n\nFor this special case the function \ntimeprec_forward(T)\n is used instead. This function results to on average 3-5 geometric relocation steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current definition of these functions is:\n\n\ntimeprec\n(\n::\nType\n{\nT\n})\n \nwhere\n \n{\nT\n}\n \n=\n \neps\n(\nT\n)\n^\n(\n4\n/\n5\n)\n\n\ntimeprec_forward\n(\n::\nType\n{\nT\n})\n \nwhere\n \n{\nT\n}\n \n=\n \neps\n(\nT\n)\n^\n(\n3\n/\n4\n)\n\n\ntimeprec_forward\n(\n::\nType\n{\nBigFloat\n})\n \n=\n \nBigFloat\n(\n1e-12\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting the global precision of \nDynamicalBilliards\n is very easy and can be done in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nChoose the floating precision you would like, by initializing your billiard table with parametric type \nT\n, e.g. \nbt = billiard_sinai(Float16(0.3))\n. This choice will propagate to the entire \nbt\n, all particles resulting from \nrandominside()\n, \nas well as the entire evolution process\n.\n\n\nRe-define the functions \ntimeprec(T)\n and \ntimeprec_forward(T)\n. Decreasing their values will make the evolution process slower, but the resulting numbers given by \nevolve!()\n will be more precise. There are no guarantees if you follow this method as it may lead to breaking code if \ntimeprec_forward\n becomes too small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBigFloats\n\n\nEvolution with \nBigFloat\n in \nDynamicalBilliards\n is on average 3 to 4 orders of magnitude slower than with \nFloat64\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinned Particles\n\n\nIn the case of propagation with magnetic field, a particle may be \"pinned\" (collision-less): There are no possible collisions that take place and the particle will revolve in circles forever. This can happen for specific initial conditions depending on your billiard table and the angular velocity \u03c9.\n\n\nIn such event, the convention followed by \nDynamicalBilliards\n is the following: \nevolve!()\n returns the expected output, however all returned vectors have only 2 entries. The collision times always have the entries \n0.0, Inf\n. All other returned vectors have the initial conditions, repeated once.\n\n\nevolve!()\n can be given an additional \nwarning\n keyword argument in the case of magnetic propagation, e.g. \nwarning = true\n. This optional argument throws a \nwarn()\n message whenever a pinned particle is evolved.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nconstruct()\n\n\nWhen using the syntax \nconstruct(evolve!(p, bt, t)...)\n be sure that there aren't any pinned particles given to evolve. If there are any, construct will result in an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVelocity measure\n\n\nBoth \nParticle\n and \nMagneticParticle\n are assumed to \nalways\n have a velocity vector of measure 1 during evolution. This simplifies the formulas used internally to a significant amount.\n\n\nHowever, during ray-splitting, the a \nMagneticParticle\n may be in areas with different angular velocities (result of the \n\u03c9_new\n function). Physically, in such a situation, the velocity measure of the particle could also change.

            "text": "All core types of  DynamicalBilliards.jl  are parametrically constructed, with parameter  T :AbstractFloat . This means that the fields of all particles and obstacles contain numbers strictly of type  T . You will understand why this choice happened as you continue reading this paragraph.  The main concerns during evolution in a billiard table are:   The particle must never leak out of the billiard table. This is simply translated to the  distance()  function being  always  positive  after  any collision.  The collision time is never infinite, besides the cases of  pinned particles  in a magnetic billiard.  The  relocate!()  process is always finite (and very swift!).   These are solved with the following approach: after the minimum collision time has been calculated, a \"test propagation\" is done on the position of the particle. If the  distance(p, obst)  with the colliding obstacle is found to be \"wrong\", the collision time is reduced by the  DynamicalBilliards.timeprec(T)  function, with  T  being the parametric type of both the particle and the obstacle. This reduction happens geometrically, i.e. the time adjusting increment is self-multiplied by 10 at each recursive relocating step.   Magnetic propagation and straight propagation both use  timeprec(T) . For both cases the maximum number of geometric iterations is 1 (for the default value of  timeprec(T) .   This  timeprec  cannot be used with  PeriodicWall  and RaySplitting obstacles with  MagneticParticle s because when relocating forward in time you get progressively shallower and shallower angles. This means that you need huge changes in time for even tiny changes in  distance .   For this special case the function  timeprec_forward(T)  is used instead. This function results to on average 3-5 geometric relocation steps.     The current definition of these functions is:  timeprec ( :: Type { T })   where   { T }   =   eps ( T ) ^ ( 4 / 5 )  timeprec_forward ( :: Type { T })   where   { T }   =   eps ( T ) ^ ( 3 / 4 )  timeprec_forward ( :: Type { BigFloat })   =   BigFloat ( 1e-12 )   Adjusting the global precision of  DynamicalBilliards  is very easy and can be done in two ways:   Choose the floating precision you would like, by initializing your billiard table with parametric type  T , e.g.  bt = billiard_sinai(Float16(0.3)) . This choice will propagate to the entire  bt , all particles resulting from  randominside() ,  as well as the entire evolution process .  Re-define the functions  timeprec(T)  and  timeprec_forward(T) . Decreasing their values will make the evolution process slower, but the resulting numbers given by  evolve!()  will be more precise. There are no guarantees if you follow this method as it may lead to breaking code if  timeprec_forward  becomes too small.    BigFloats  Evolution with  BigFloat  in  DynamicalBilliards  is on average 3 to 4 orders of magnitude slower than with  Float64 .",

            "text": "Ray-Splitting\n\n\nRay-splitting is a semi-classical approach to the billiard system, giving a wave attribute to the ray traced by the particle. Upon collision a particle may propagate through an obstacle (transmission \n refraction) or be reflected. Following the mindset of this package, implementing a ray-splitting billiard requires only three simple steps. We will introduce them and demonstrate them using a simple example in this documentation page.\n\n\n\n\n1. Ray-Splitting Obstacles\n\n\nThe first step is that an \nObstacle\n that supports ray-splitting is required to be present in your billiard table. The only new feature these obstacles have is an additional Boolean field called \npflag\n (propagation flag). This field notes on which side of the obstacle the particle is currently propagating.\n\n\nThe normal vector as well as the distance from boundary change sign depending on the value of \npflag\n. The obstacles \nAntidot\n and \nSplitterWall\n are the equivalents of disk and wall for ray-splitting.\n\n\nLet's create a billiard with a bunch of ray-splitting obstacles!\n\n\nusing\n \nDynamicalBilliards\n\n\nx\n,\n \ny\n \n=\n \n2.0\n,\n \n1.0\n\n\nbtr\n \n=\n  \nbilliard_rectangle\n(\nx\n,\n \ny\n)\n\n\nsw\n \n=\n \nSplitterWall\n([\nx\n/\n2\n,\n \n0.0\n],\n \n[\nx\n/\n2\n,\ny\n],\n \n[\n-\n1\n,\n0\n],\n \ntrue\n)\n\n\na1\n \n=\n \nAntidot\n([\nx\n/\n4\n,\n \ny\n/\n2\n],\n \n0.25\n,\n \nLeft Antidot\n)\n\n\na2\n \n=\n \nAntidot\n([\n3\nx\n/\n4\n,\n \ny\n/\n2\n],\n \n0.15\n,\n \nRight Antidot\n)\n\n\nbt\n \n=\n \nBilliard\n(\na1\n,\n \na2\n,\n \nsw\n,\n \nbtr\n...\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBilliard{Float64} with 7 obstacles:\n  Left Antidot\n  Right Antidot\n  Splitter wall\n  Bottom wall\n  Right wall\n  Top wall\n  Left wall\n\n\n\n\n\nand plot it:\n\n\nusing\n \nPyPlot\n\n\nplot_billiard\n(\nbt\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The \nRaySplitter\n structure\n\n\nIn the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability, refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:\n\n\n#\n\n\nDynamicalBilliards.RaySplitter\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nRaySplitter(idxs, transmission, refraction [, newangular]; affect)\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn a \nRaySplitter\n instance, used to perform raysplitting. \nidxs\n is a \nVector{Int}\n with the indices of the obstacles that this \nRaySplitter\n corresponds to.\n\n\ntransmission\n, \nrefraction\n and \nnewangular\n are \nfunctions\n. Let \n\u03c6\n be the angle of incidence and \n\u03c9\n be the angular velocity (before transmission). The functions have the following signatures:\n\n\n\n\ntransmission(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n T\n : Transmission probability \nT\n depending on whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle (\npflag\n) and optionally depending on \u03c9.\n\n\nrefraction(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -\n \u03b8\n : Refraction angle \n\u03b8\n depending on whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle (\npflag\n) and optionally depending on \n\u03c9\n. This angle is \nrelative\n to the normal vector.\n\n\nnewangular(\u03c9, pflag) -\n new\u03c9\n : New angular velocity after transmission. Notice that \nnewangular\n is an optional argument and defaults to \n(\u03c9, pflag) -\n \u03c9\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe above three functions use the \nsame convention\n: the argument \npflag\n is the one the obstacle has \nbefore transmission\n. For example, if a particle is outside an \nAntidot\n (with \npflag = true\n here) and is transmitted inside the \nAntidot\n (\npflag\n becomes \nfalse\n here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the Boolean one) as \ntrue\n!\n\n\nAlso notice that the call signature \nmust\n be as stated, irrespectively of whether some of the arguments are used in the functions.\n\n\naffect\n is a function, and denotes which obstacles of the billiard are affected when transmission occurs at obstacle \ni\n (for which obstacles should the field \npflag\n be reversed). Defaults to \nidxs = (i) -\n i\n, i.e. only the colliding obstacle is affected. If you want many obstacles to be affected you could write \nidxs = (i) -\n SVector(2,3,5)\n, etc. Keep in mind that the only values of \ni\n that can be passed into this function are the ones that are given in the argument \nidxs\n!\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nIf you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for different obstacles, then you define multiple \nRaySplitter\ns.\n\n\nContinuing from the above billiard, let's also create some \nRaySplitter\n instances for it.\n\n\nFirst define a refraction function\n\n\nrefraction\n \n=\n \n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \npflag\n \n?\n \n0.5\n\u03c6\n \n:\n \n2.0\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a function that given some factor \np\n, it returns a probability weighted with \np\n in one direction of ray-splitting and \n1-p\n in another direction.\n\n\ntransmission_p\n \n=\n \n(\np\n)\n \n-\n \n(\n\u03c6\n,\n \npflag\n,\n \n\u03c9\n)\n \n-\n \nbegin\n\n    \nif\n \npflag\n\n        \np\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n8\n)\n^\n2\n)\n\n    \nelse\n\n        \nabs\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n \n \n\u03c0\n/\n4\n \n?\n \n(\n1\n-\np\n)\n*\nexp\n(\n-\n(\n\u03c6\n)\n^\n2\n/\n2\n(\n\u03c0\n/\n4\n)\n^\n2\n)\n \n:\n \n0.0\n\n    \nend\n\n\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is respected, i.e. if \n\u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2\n then \nT(\u03c6) = 0\n.\n\n\nLastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions such that the antidots also reverse the direction of the magnetic field\n\n\nnewoantidot\n \n=\n \n((\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n-\n \nbool\n \n?\n \n-\n2.0\nx\n \n:\n \n-\n0.5\nx\n)\n\n\nnewowall\n \n=\n \n((\nx\n,\n \nbool\n)\n \n-\n \nbool\n \n?\n \n0.5\nx\n \n:\n \n2.0\nx\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we create the \nRaySplitter\n instances we want\n\n\nraywall\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n3\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.5\n),\n \nrefraction\n;\n \nnewangular\n \n=\n \nnewowall\n)\n\n\nraya\n \n=\n \nRaySplitter\n([\n1\n,\n \n2\n],\n \ntransmission_p\n(\n0.8\n),\n \nrefraction\n;\n \nnewangular\n \n=\n \nnewoantidot\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave both indices in \nraya\n, \n[1, 2]\n (which are the indices of the antidots in the billiard \nbt\n).\n\n\n\n\n3. Evolution with Ray-Splitting\n\n\nThe third step is trivial. After you have created your \nRaySplitter\n(s), you simply pass them into \nevolve\n or \nanimate_evolution\n as a fourth argument! If you have many instances of \nRaySplitter\n you pass a tuple of them.\n\n\nFor example, doing\n\n\np\n \n=\n \nrandominside\n(\nbt\n,\n \n1.0\n)\n\n\nraysplitters\n \n=\n \n(\nraywall\n,\n \nraya\n)\n\n\nxt\n,\n \nyt\n,\n \nvxt\n,\n \nvyt\n,\n \ntt\n \n=\n \nconstruct\n(\nevolve\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n1000.0\n,\n \nraysplitters\n)\n...\n)\n\n\nanimate_evolution\n(\np\n,\n \nbt\n,\n \n100\n,\n \nraysplitters\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill produce \n\n\n\n\nResetting the billiard\n\n\nNotice that evolving a particle inside a billiard always mutates the billiard if ray-splitting is used. This means that you should always set the fields \npflag\n of some obstacles to the values you desire after \neach\n call to \nevolve\n. If you use the function \nrandominside\n you must definitely do this!\n\n\nThe function \nreset_billiard!(bt)\n turns all \npflag\ns to \ntrue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngle of refraction is clamped\n\n\nInternally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function to \n-\u03c0/2 + 0.1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - 0.1\n. This is so that the relocating algorithm does not fall into an infinite loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ray-Splitting Algorithm\n\n\nIn this section we describe the algorithm we follow to implement the ray-splitting process. Let \nT\nT\n denote the transmission function, \n\\theta\n\\theta\n the refraction function and \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}\n the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.\n\n\n\n\nFind the angle of incidence \n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n\\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))\n with \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n gives the angle between 0 and \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n instead of \n\\pi/2\n\\pi/2\n to \n\\pi\n\\pi\n.\n\n\nFind the \ncorrect\n sign of the incidence angle, \n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n\\phi = \\pm \\phi'\n. Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of \n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}\n is negative, then have minus sign. The \"correct\" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of \n(-\\vec{n})\n(-\\vec{n})\n. This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.\n\n\nCheck if \nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \n \\text{random}()\nT(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) > \\text{random}()\n. If not, do standard specular reflection.\n\n\nIf ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the \nother\n side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.\n\n\nRe-compute the \ncorrect\n angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.\n\n\nFind refraction angle \n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n\\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)\n. Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that \n\\theta\n\\theta\n may have opposite sign from \n\\phi\n\\phi\n. It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.\n\n\nSet \nobstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag\n for \nall\n obstacles affected by the current \nRaySplitter\n. This reverses \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n to \n-\\vec{n}\n-\\vec{n}\n as well! So from now on \n\\vec{n}\n\\vec{n}\n is the opposite than what it was at the beginning of the algorithm!\n\n\nFind the refraction angle in absolute space. First find \na = \\text{atan2}(n_y, n_x)\na = \\text{atan2}(n_y, n_x)\n and then set \n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n\\Theta = a + \\theta\n.\n\n\nPerform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of \n\\Theta\n\\Theta\n.\n\n\nScale the magnetic field, i.e. set \np.omega\n = \n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n\\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|)\n. It is important to note that we use \n!pflag\n because we have already changed the \npflag\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics of the Ray-Splitting Functions\n\n\nIf \nT\n is the transmission probability function, then the condition for transmission is simply: \nT(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) \n rand()\n. If it returns \ntrue\n, transmission (i.e. ray-splitting) will happen. As it has already been discussed, the condition of total internal reflection must be taken care of by the user.\n\n\nThe functions given to \nRaySplitter\n should have some properties in order to have physical meaning.

            "text": "In the second step, you have to define 2+1 functions: transmission probability, refraction angle and optionally new angular velocity after transmission. These functions, as well as which obstacles participate in ray-splitting, are bundled into a special structure:  #  DynamicalBilliards.RaySplitter     Type .  RaySplitter(idxs, transmission, refraction [, newangular]; affect)  Return a  RaySplitter  instance, used to perform raysplitting.  idxs  is a  Vector{Int}  with the indices of the obstacles that this  RaySplitter  corresponds to.  transmission ,  refraction  and  newangular  are  functions . Let  \u03c6  be the angle of incidence and  \u03c9  be the angular velocity (before transmission). The functions have the following signatures:   transmission(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -  T  : Transmission probability  T  depending on whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle ( pflag ) and optionally depending on \u03c9.  refraction(\u03c6, pflag, \u03c9) -  \u03b8  : Refraction angle  \u03b8  depending on whether the particle is inside or outside the obstacle ( pflag ) and optionally depending on  \u03c9 . This angle is  relative  to the normal vector.  newangular(\u03c9, pflag) -  new\u03c9  : New angular velocity after transmission. Notice that  newangular  is an optional argument and defaults to  (\u03c9, pflag) -  \u03c9 .   The above three functions use the  same convention : the argument  pflag  is the one the obstacle has  before transmission . For example, if a particle is outside an  Antidot  (with  pflag = true  here) and is transmitted inside the  Antidot  ( pflag  becomes  false  here), then all three functions will be given their second argument (the Boolean one) as  true !  Also notice that the call signature  must  be as stated, irrespectively of whether some of the arguments are used in the functions.  affect  is a function, and denotes which obstacles of the billiard are affected when transmission occurs at obstacle  i  (for which obstacles should the field  pflag  be reversed). Defaults to  idxs = (i) -  i , i.e. only the colliding obstacle is affected. If you want many obstacles to be affected you could write  idxs = (i) -  SVector(2,3,5) , etc. Keep in mind that the only values of  i  that can be passed into this function are the ones that are given in the argument  idxs !  source   If you want different type of transmission/refraction functions for different obstacles, then you define multiple  RaySplitter s.  Continuing from the above billiard, let's also create some  RaySplitter  instances for it.  First define a refraction function  refraction   =   ( \u03c6 ,   pflag ,   \u03c9 )   -   pflag   ?   0.5 \u03c6   :   2.0 \u03c6   Then, a transmission probability function. In this example, we want to create a function that given some factor  p , it returns a probability weighted with  p  in one direction of ray-splitting and  1-p  in another direction.  transmission_p   =   ( p )   -   ( \u03c6 ,   pflag ,   \u03c9 )   -   begin \n     if   pflag \n         p * exp ( - ( \u03c6 ) ^ 2 / 2 ( \u03c0 / 8 ) ^ 2 ) \n     else \n         abs ( \u03c6 )     \u03c0 / 4   ?   ( 1 - p ) * exp ( - ( \u03c6 ) ^ 2 / 2 ( \u03c0 / 4 ) ^ 2 )   :   0.0 \n     end  end   Notice also how we defined the function in such a way that critical refraction is respected, i.e. if  \u03b8(\u03c6) \u2265 \u03c0/2  then  T(\u03c6) = 0 .  Lastly, for this example we will use magnetic propagation. We define functions such that the antidots also reverse the direction of the magnetic field  newoantidot   =   (( x ,   bool )   -   bool   ?   - 2.0 x   :   - 0.5 x )  newowall   =   (( x ,   bool )   -   bool   ?   0.5 x   :   2.0 x )   Now we create the  RaySplitter  instances we want  raywall   =   RaySplitter ([ 3 ],   transmission_p ( 0.5 ),   refraction ;   newangular   =   newowall )  raya   =   RaySplitter ([ 1 ,   2 ],   transmission_p ( 0.8 ),   refraction ;   newangular   =   newoantidot )   Because we want to use same functions for both antidots, we gave both indices in  raya ,  [1, 2]  (which are the indices of the antidots in the billiard  bt ).",

The function  reset_billiard!(bt)  turns all  pflag s to  true .    Angle of refraction is clamped  Internally we clamp the output of the angle of refraction function to  -\u03c0/2 + 0.1 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0/2 - 0.1 .

Let  T T  denote the transmission function,  \\theta \\theta  the refraction function and  \\omega_{\\text{new}} \\omega_{\\text{new}}  the new angular velocity function. The following describes the process after a particle has reached an obstacle that supports ray-splitting.   Find the angle of incidence  \\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n})) \\phi' = \\pi - \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{n}) = \\arccos(\\vec{v} \\cdot (-\\vec{n}))  with  \\vec{n} \\vec{n}  the normal vector at collision point. Notice that we use here  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  because the velocity is opposing the normal vector before the collision happens. Using  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  gives the angle between 0 and  \\pi/2 \\pi/2  instead of  \\pi/2 \\pi/2  to  \\pi \\pi .  Find the  correct  sign of the incidence angle,  \\phi = \\pm \\phi' \\phi = \\pm \\phi' . Specifically, use the cross product: if the third entry of  \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n} \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{n}  is negative, then have minus sign. The \"correct\" sign debates on whether the velocity vector is to the right or to the left of  (-\\vec{n}) (-\\vec{n}) . This is important for finding the correct transmission angle and/or probability.  Check if  T(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega)   \\text{random}() T(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) > \\text{random}() . If not, do standard specular reflection.  If ray-splitting happens, then relocate the particle so that it is on the  other  side of the colliding obstacle. This contrasts the main evolution algorithm of this billiard package.  Re-compute the  correct  angle of incidence, as the position of the particle generally changes with relocating.  Find refraction angle  \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) \\theta(\\phi, \\verb|pflag|, \\omega) . Notice that this is a relative angle with respect to the normal vector. Also notice that  \\theta \\theta  may have opposite sign from  \\phi \\phi . It depends on the user if they want to add anomalous refraction.  Set  obstacle.pflag = !obstacle.pflag  for  all  obstacles affected by the current  RaySplitter . This reverses  \\vec{n} \\vec{n}  to  -\\vec{n} -\\vec{n}  as well!

First find  a = \\text{atan2}(n_y, n_x) a = \\text{atan2}(n_y, n_x)  and then set  \\Theta = a + \\theta \\Theta = a + \\theta .  Perform refraction, i.e. set the particle velocity to the direction of  \\Theta \\Theta .  Scale the magnetic field, i.e. set  p.omega  =  \\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|) \\omega_{\\text{new}}(\\omega, \\verb|!pflag|) .
